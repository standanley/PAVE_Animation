# PAVE_Animation
This application is meant to be a graphical display of what the autonomous car is "thinking" in real time.
It uses SDL to do the graphics, and at least for now is not using any additional libraries for SDL (although this may change to work with compressed images or text). 
If you need help setting up SDL, use this tutorial: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php.
